# Titanic Dataset Practice Questions

## Beginner Level (Easy)

1. How many passengers are there in the dataset?
2. How many passengers survived and how many did not survive?
3. Count male vs female passengers.
4. Find the number of passengers in each passenger class (Pclass).
5. Find the youngest and oldest passenger.
6. Calculate the average age of passengers.
7. How many passengers have missing age values?
8. List the first 10 passenger names.
9. How many passengers embarked from each port (S, C, Q)?
10. How many children (Age < 10) were on board? How many survived?


## Intermediate Level

1. Calculate the survival rate (percentage).
2. Compare survival rate by gender. Who had a better chance?
3. Compare survival rate across passenger classes.
4. Calculate the average fare paid by each class.
5. Find the passenger who paid the highest fare.
6. Find the distribution of siblings/spouses (SibSp).
7. Group passengers by age groups: Child (0–12), Teen (13–19), Adult (20–50), Senior (50+). Count each group.
8. How many passengers traveled alone (SibSp = 0 and Parch = 0)?
9. Find the average age of survivors vs non-survivors.
10. List all female passengers who survived and were in 1st class.

## Advanced / Hard Level

1. Build a survival prediction manually using simple rules (e.g., female + 1st class more likely to survive) and calculate prediction accuracy.
2. Find correlation between numerical fields such as Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, and Survived.
3. Analyze family size impact: Calculate family size (SibSp + Parch + 1) and survival rate for each family size.
4. Identify passengers with the same last name (family groups). Check if they survived together.
5. Calculate the median age for each Pclass and compare survival.
6. Investigate whether fare affected survival probability by splitting fare into quartiles.
7. Detect outliers in fare using the IQR method and identify passengers who paid unusually high fares.
8. Compute survival probability based on multiple features (Sex, Pclass, Age group).
9. Find the top 10 most common first names among passengers.
10. Determine if passengers with cabin numbers (non-missing Cabin values) had higher survival rates.
